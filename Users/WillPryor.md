## About Me
I'm a **sophomore CS** student. I am also a member of the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Team. I am one of the Outreach leaders for inVenTs Rocketry, and I am also an Outreach committee member and a mentor for Galileo.

## Why I joined inVenTs rocketry
I'm fascinated by space exploration and the aerospace industry, but I'm interested in the computer side rather than the aerospace engineering side. This team seems like a great way to explore that interest and work as part of a team of engineers to compete in a fun competition.
