## About Me

I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at Virginia Tech with various interests in the field including machine learning, software development, and user interface design(Humann-Computer Interaction). I joined InVenTs Rocktry in September 2017 and worked as a member of the Mechanical Subteam to design and build the rocket that was launch in Minnesota for the NASA's Space Grant Midwest High-Power Rocketry Competition. This year (2018), I'm the lead of the software subteam that is under the overall electronics branch of the team.

##Why I joined InVenTs Rocketry
I was unsure about what engineering field to study when I was a freshman. Through the team, I experienced various aspect of Areospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering/Computer Science. In the end, I decided that I like the software aspect of things but I still throughly enjoy spending my time with team members and buiding rockets together. So, this is why I'm still part of the club and I'm excited to participate in this year's competition!
