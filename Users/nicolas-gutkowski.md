## About
I am a junior studying computer science at Virginia Tech with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction.  
I joined inVenTs Rocketry in September of 2017 and worked as a member of the electronics subteam to implement
a system to control the orientation and roll of the rocket.  
As of August 2018 I serve as the head of the electonics subteam, in addition to assisting the safety officer.

## Why I joined inVenTs Rocketry
I joined inVenTs Rocketry due to my prior experience of being on a rocketry team that competed in the NASA Student Launch
Initiative. As part of that team I served as a member of the electronics subteam in addition to having the role of safety officer.  
This sparked my interest in rocketry as a hobby and I wanted to continue participating in competitions. When I came to
Virginia Tech I joined inVenTs Rocketry having heard of it from a friend who used to be a member of the team.
